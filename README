1.	House cleaning before getting start
	a)	Make sure the Vitis 2019.2 release installed
	b)	Make sure the Petalinux 2019.2 release installed
	c)	Download the VCK190 Petalinux BSP files
	d)	Make sure your VCK190 board ethernet cable and USB connection are working

2.	Modify files according to your environment
	$vi gen_pdi/Makefile  
	Modify the variable PETALNX_BSP to your location of VCK190 BSP file

	$vi src_app/Makefile
	Modify the variable BOARD_IP to your VCK190 linux IP address

3.	Choose the target you want to run
	a)	launch Co-simulation
	$cd gen_pdi
	$make cosim
	
	b)	Generate FPGA bitstream and AIE binary
	$cd gen_pdi
	$make pdi
	
	c)	Generate Petalinux image and test application
	$cd gen_pdi
	$make images

4. Run the test on VCK190 board
	a)	Generate Petalinux images and test application as above
	
	b)	Launch Vivado to download PDI
	$vivado
	Open hardware manager
	Select images/design_1_aie.pdi and images/debug_nets.ltx
	Setup ILAs
	
	c)  Download ATF, device tree, u-boot and linux image
	$cd images
	$xsdb 
	
	d)	Open putty to connect uart and set rate 115200, and type following command on putty
	Versal>bootm 0x10000000 


	e)	Login linux with username:root/passwd:root

	f)	Set IP on VCK190 board 
	$ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.188


5. Upload linux test application to VCK190 board
	$cd src_app
	$make all
	This will upload binary and data to VCK190 board. Make sure the ethernet connect between your workstation and VCK190 boar is working. 

6.	Launch testing program on VCK190 board through UART
	$/home/root/bf_ifft_test.exe
